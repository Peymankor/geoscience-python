## Purpose

Create practical data analysis and data science online reproducible sphinx booklet for common Geoscience and Petroleum Engineering problems. Key is to enable people to solve their own problems.

What kind of code will we be using?
* Personal automation
* Consistent ways of writing code
* Code that you are writing for yourself and you are the only person who is going to be using it
* <del>Professional code<del>
* <del>Checked in code<del>
* <del>Reviewed code<del>
  
You can some cut corners, write some crappy code and do some things that questionable but all of it is just fine -
no one will ever see it and no one will ever know.

**Main goal - solve your problem!**

**Motivate you to maybe dive in deeper and become semi-professional one day!**
