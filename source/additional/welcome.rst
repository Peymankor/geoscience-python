What will you learn in this book?
===================

I would like to enable you to do the following things to your data:
1) visualize in a quick and easy way (grammar of graphics)
2) clean it using pyjanitor library, i.e. by applying verb based functional API approach
3) clean your data using non-verb based pandas functional API approach
4) use public data and problematics from the domain of geology and geophysics throughout the examples we provide
