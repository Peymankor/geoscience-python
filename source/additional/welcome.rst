Welcome!!
===================

**Purpose**

Create practical data analysis and data science online reproducible sphinx booklet for common Geoscience and Petroleum Engineering problems. Key is to enable people to solve their own problems.

**What kind of code will we be using?**

* Personal automation
* Consistent ways of writing code
* Code that you are writing for yourself and you are the only person who is going to be using it

**What kind of code will we NOT be using?**

* Professional code
* Checked in code
* Reviewed code

You can some cut corners, write some crappy code and do some things that questionable but all of it is just fine - no one will ever see it and no one will ever know.

**Main goal - solve your problem!**

**Motivate you to maybe dive in deeper and become semi-professional one day!**

I would like to enable you to do the following things to your data:

1) visualize in a quick and easy way (grammar of graphics)

2) clean it using pyjanitor library, i.e. by applying verb based functional API approach

3) clean your data using non-verb based pandas functional API approach

4) use public data and problematics from the domain of geology and geophysics throughout the examples we provide
